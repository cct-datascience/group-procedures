A public facing version of what we do and how to work with us is available at our website.\nThe CCT Data Science Team is a research support unit that helps life sciences researchers learn and apply data science tools and skills to their scientific projects. We are a small group of data scientists and research software engineers that work with domain researchers in the ALVSCE division through a variety of programming. We host workshops to demonstrate use of modern computational tools, work on collaborative projects, and help researchers one-on-one. The team teaches and applies a broad array of topics from best practices in R to version control using git to open and reproducible research workflows.",

The MS Office calendars are used by other groups, and our group mostly uses them to keep informed of activities.\nIt’s possible to connect an Office calendar to your Google calendar: forum instructions.\nOur group has a group-wide calendar for communicating within the group. If you can’t add this calendar to your account, ask someone in the group to add you.\nSee the rest of this page for when to use the group’s calendar.\n\n\n5 Working hours and time off\n\nEveryone is expected to be in during normal working hours. Since we are distributed across time zones, work with Kristina to establish your working hours.\nPlease let Kristina know at least 2 weeks in advance of any vacation time.\nYou can ask HR (or look in UAccess) to track your available sick and vacation time. This is an important and valuable part of your compensation!\nPlease be sure to update the CCT Group Calendar with your time off. The calendar entry only needs to include your name and when you will be out; details about the what or why are not necessary.\n\n\n\n6 Communication\n\nWe use multiple methods of communication: In Person, Email, Slack, GitHub, Zoom, Google Drive, Google Calendars; see Group Communication for details.\nWe should all aim to reply to inquiries within a day. If someone doesn’t reply in a timely fashion, please remind them early, often, and through multiple channels.\nEveryone should do their best to keep their calendars up to date, to make scheduling meetings with collaborators, etc. easier.\n\n\n\n7 Feedback and Iteration\nFeedback is essential to our group. Expect me to ask for it, and expect to provide feedback at any time, through any channel. Please let me know if you have any questions.\n\n\n8 Time reporting\n\nInform Kristina by email of upcoming vacation or leave as soon as is practical; at least two weeks in advance.\nEmployees must report their time by 10:00 a.m. on the Friday of a non-pay week. Supervisors (time approvers) must approve time by 5:00 p.m. on that day. See https://hr.arizona.edu/supervisors/compensation\nFor Appointed personnel, you only need to report leave time (sick, vacation, jury duty, etc). Holidays and campus closures are automatically added to your time sheet. For more information on winter holiday closure: https://hr.arizona.edu/events/winter-closure\n\n\n\n9 Computer backups\n\nWe should all keep backups of our computers in at least two place - ideally, one in the cloud and one on a physical hard drive.\nAlso, push to GitHub at least daily!",

    "section": "4.2 Time Tracking",
    "text": "4.2 Time Tracking\nWe use Toggl to track the time each group member spends working on each of the (many) projects that we all contribute to.\nThis began with the Data Science Incubator, when it became prudent to track the time spent working on each project. We now use it in order to be fair to our collaborators and funders by quantifying the time spent on projects, and making sure that we are allocating effort appropriately across projects. We also use it to populate the Group Effort Spreadsheet, which we use to communicate our activities to stakeholders within the university.\n\n4.2.1 Toggl conventions\n\nProjects: Each group member likely contributes to many projects. Each Incubator project, externally funded project, workshop or training, or event should get its own project. Group work (e.g. one-on-ones, group meetings, sprint planning) falls under the Group Work project. Although some work may not fall into a project and be appropriately categorized as “no project”, assigning work to projects makes it much easier to track later.\nLabels: In addition to assigning time to a project, you can assign a label (such as “email”, “meetings”, “workshops pre and post”). We use these to get a pulse of how much time we spend on different types of activities. Assigning labels is less important than assigning projects.\nArchiving: When a project is completed, you can archive it. The time entries will remain logged, but you will no longer be able to add time to it.\nPublic/private: Unless there is a strong reason to create a private project, create projects as shared across the whole group. This enables us to quickly see how much time we as a group have spent on a project, in addition to each team members’ hours.\nPrecision: Generally, hourly to half-day precision is sufficient. We estimate our time as percentages of FTE, not billed down to the minute.\nComprehensiveness: In keeping with the percentages philosophy, the goal is not to account for 100% of everyone’s time. You certainly can use it to track everything, but it’s not a tool for checking up on members’ work hours.\nOverthinking: Time tracking is meant to be a tool to improve our efficiency and self-awareness around work! It should not become so detailed or complex that it turns into a task of its own.",

These are used to plan, assess, and report. Importantly, these metrics are not used to assess individual performance.

For example, a better work-life balance, freedom to solve interesting problems and opportunities to work with scientists and engineers at the cutting edge without the constraint of quarterly sales objectives.\nThe University has a structured system called UCAP, defined below, for standardizing positions and aligning salaries across campus with current market rates.\n\n14.0.3.1 The University Career Architecture Project (UCAP)\nSalaries, raises, and promotion are governed by the University Career Architecture Project.

They will be in either the Research and Data Analysis or Research Engineering Job functions within the Research Job families.\nWe strive to have transparency and equity within the group as well as among our peers. Like most public institutions, salaries at the University of Arizona are public (the library lists salary databases by year). Salaries follow the University of Arizona Pay Structure.\nSalaries in DIAG range from $30k for a recent graduate to $85k for developers with 10-15 years of experience in relevant technologies and the ability to take on substantial leadership and mentoring roles.\n\n\n\n14.0.4 Appendix: Skills Matrix\nNote: 6 and 7 are specific to a pipeline job; other positions may have additional required/desired skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory of interest\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1.

This is totally optional, but please do let us know if there’s anyone you’d like to talk to and we’ll do our best to arrange a meeting with them on the same day as the rest of your interview!\nTo confirm your availability and secure your slot for the full-day interview, please let us know your top three days in the week of May 15–19. Please also let us know what time zone you’ll be joining from. We understand that a full-day interview requires a significant time commitment and we appreciate your time. If none of these dates work for you, or if it is necessary to split the meetings across two days, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate.\nOnce again, congratulations on making it to this stage in the hiring process. We look forward to exploring further how your skills and interests can contribute to the success of our team.\nSincerely,\nEric Scott\n\n\n\n\n14.0.6 Appendix: Screening Interview\n\n14.0.6.1 Questions\nDistilled from UA HR: Library of Interview Questions and David’s suggestions by Julian.\nIntroductory questions\n\nWhen you read the job ad, what is one thing about it that interested you?\nTell us a little about yourself.\nWhat interests you about this job?\nDescribe your ideal work environment.\n\n1.

    "text": "16.2 How to do a code review\n\n16.2.1 1. Identify the goal posts\nThis rubric can help structure your review. You may want to flesh out the categories according to the following:\n\nProduct functionality: what is the software supposed to do? How do we know when it’s working? Be as specific as possible - you want a list of expectations that can be verified.\n\nFor an R package, this might be a list of the core functions and their behavior, including any automated or repository-specific checks (e.g. CRAN, ROpenSci checklists) that must pass.\nFor a Shiny app, a description of the app components and their intended functionality.\nThe authors/developers can help the review process by providing this list alongside the codebase.\n\nUser-facing documentation: what tools does a user need to use the product successfully, and are they sufficient?\n\nFor all projects, this includes\n\na README\na license/set of guidelines for re-use\na CITATION file\nany required funding acknowledgements\n\nFor an R package, this includes function documentation, vignettes, etc.\nFor a Shiny app, this includes app instructions.\n\nDeveloper-facing documentation: what does a naive developer need to understand in order to potentially modify or debug the code?\n\nA description of the file structure and explanation of each item\nSufficient code commenting\nLogical naming and organization strategies\n\nCode accuracy and stability\n\nChecking for bugs\n(Somewhat subjective) could the code be made more modular/less repetitive?\n(Possibly) checking for foreseeable software rot issues. (e.g. tidyverse functions can change quickly, and may not be desirable dependencies for R packages).\n\nReproducibility/portability\n\nAre the necessary components included to run the code/reproduce the analysis on a new machine/with new data?\n\n\n\n\n16.2.2 2. Check things off the list!\n\nFork or otherwise create a working copy of the codebase that you can experiment with and modify.\nWork from the big-picture to granular. E.g. check that things install and produce expected output; then check for stylistic questions.\nPace yourself as a reviewer - you can only absorb so much at once, and code review efficacy drops off after about an hour of focused work or, according to one study, about 200 LOC.\n\n\n\n16.2.3 3. Ask questions and suggest modifications\n\nIf you have suggested modifications that you can make yourself (e.g. changing comments, catching easy typos), create well-documented commits in your forked repository.\nFor larger modifications, or questions, document the issue thoroughly and reach out to the authors to work together to clarify or resolve things.",

It is preferable if these are under a collaborator account or organization from the get go.\nAdd GitHub epic for incubator project to incubator board when initially developing the project—that way we can have a backlog of ideas and potential projects.\nCreate an Epic with sub-tasks for each project plan to track progress internally.\nMove epic through relevant categories as project progresses.\nTrack time in approximately hourly increments on group’s Toggl page.\nThe two weeks of FTE work is the time required to complete the proposed scope of work. Additional time for planning, writing the project plan, and follow up post-project plan aren’t included in this. However, for purposes of reporting it is useful to know or be able to reasonably estimate the total time spent.",

I looked over the goals we set out to accomplish in the original project plan, and I think we’ve done a good job meeting them.\n\nStatic QA/QC routines that check data prior to going into the database ✅\nStatic checks for whether data for a station was retrieved in the previous hour: I don’t think we put this one into place yet, but this could be a pretty simple addition to the report that just checks for NAs. I opened an issue to remind me to look into this.\nA simple R package to wrap the API ✅\nA “dynamic” QA/QC procedure that compares recent data to historical ✅\nA Cooperative Extension bulletin describing the new AZMet QA/QC procedures: I’d be happy to help spread the word and provide edits to a draft bulletin. I also need to write a blog-post for our website and promote the azmet R package.\nAvailability of code on GitHub with a permissive open source license ✅\n\nAt our meeting on Monday, we’ll discuss any final steps to the incubator phase and next steps for continued collaboration (i.e. funding continued work on the QA/QC report). We’ll also have a conversation about the incubator process itself—what worked well, what didn’t work, and what could be improved.\nLooking forward to seeing you then!\n\n\n\n\n\n19.5.2 Wrap-up Meeting\nHave a final meeting. Here are some questions you can ask:\n\nDo you feel like you have the resources you need to take ownership (with our continued support)?\nDo you feel we met the objectives of the project plan?\nDid the project take longer, shorter, or about as long as you expected?\nFor each phase of the incubator (project plan writing, work, and wrap-up): What went well? What didn’t go well? What suggestions do you have for improvement?\nIs it ok to share the product on our blog, social media, in UA newsletters, etc. (as appropriate)?\nWhat/when is the next step for continued work or funding (as appropriate)?\n\nTake notes on the answers and share them with the team at the next incubator meeting.\n\n\n19.5.3 After the meeting\n\nWrite a blog post on finished product, including links to repository and any other outputs. This can rely heavily on the project plan, README contents, other content generated during the project.\nAdd the incubator to our website\nDone isn’t defined as the end of the collaboration. We can still provide ongoing support during the publication process and through office hours, help define follow on projects, allocate time paid by external funding, assist in project plan development.",

Many other great IDEs exist, e.g. VSCode, but it is okay in teaching, documentation, and demos to assume that learners will have access to RStudio.\n\n\n23.4.2 PyCharm\nWe are eligible for free PyCharm Educator licenses\nI received the following instructions in an email from customer support:\nif you are using this license for academic research, you are eligible to apply for a free Educational license below:\nhttp://www.jetbrains.com/student\nIf your institution domain is not available in the application, please attach your student/faculty ID and/or report card to the “OFFICIAL DOCUMENT” tab.\nTo Renew each year: (From their FAQ), “use the dedicated link in your JetBrains Account, or use a link from the automatic email reminder we send out one week before your subscription expires”\n\n\n23.4.3 Navicat\nWhen using databases, we can get licenses for open source projects as long as we put the Navicat logo on our website (as is done for TERRA REF).\n\n\n23.4.4 Postman\nA free program that is useful for investigating and creating API endpoints.\n\n\n23.4.5 Adobe tools:\nUA has a site license for these powerful tools. For example, Acrobat Pro for PDF annotation and signing; Adobe Xd for UI mockups. See https://adobe.arizona.edu/ for more information. Those whose primary appointment is in CCT will need to request a License from Ryan Creswan: cresawn@arizona.edu. Otherwse, there is a link to a spreadsheet with all of the Adobe campus reps on this page.\n\n\n23.4.6 Training Videos\nRecording Zoom sessions is a great place to start. But often it is useful to edit these videos.\n\nOBS Studio is an open source software for video recording, editing, and live streaming welcome.\nCamtasia is a commercial video editing software; contact Kristina if you would like a license.\nYou can also edit videos directly in YouTube with YouTube Studio\n\n\n\n23.4.7 GIS\n\nQGIS is a widely used and fully featured open source GIS IDE. We should use this for teaching and documentation (unless python or R will work and the workflow can be scripted).\nArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro run on Windows. UA has a campus license to these and other ESRI services. And for Windows users there is an Excel plugin for simple maps. UA GIS also provides https://uagis.maps.arcgis.com/ for sharing map data.\nTyson Swetnam has his Cloud based Ubuntu desktop enabled for GIS.\n\n\n\n23.4.8 Survey123\nSurvey123 is part of ESRI’s offerings at the University of Arizona.\nIt is a cross-platform survey form that doesn’t need internet connection to work. These forms can become complex and have multiple subforms along with response-displayable content; optional content shows depending on the answer to a question.\nThe online form create site allows the development of multi-page, single form surveys.

People who send you emails from .gov accounts will have their emails bounce if your email is automatically forwarded.\n\n\nStaff members have both an outlook and a gmail account (outlook is default). To set up the gmail, log into outlook.office.com with the netID@email.arizona.edu and search for the forwarding setup. Your forwarding address is netID@catmail.arizona.edu. Then, go to catmail.arizona.edu and sign in. University emails sent to netID@arizona.edu (outlook) should now be forwarded to netID@email.arizona.edu (gmail).\n\nEnable Google Services\n\nIn order to enable Google services on your account, we will need to enable G-Suite on your account.\nTo enable G-Suite, you will need to sign in at https://account.arizona.edu with your NetID and password.\nThen, click on “Manage your Accounts” on the left-hand side of the page. You should now be on a page with “Existing Accounts” and “Available Accounts”.\nUnder “Available Accounts” should be “UA Google Apps for Education”. You will need to click that tile to enable G-Suite.\nAfter that, Google services should be available for you and we can set up forwarding.\nYou may already have Google Services enabled. If so you should see a large green banner that says: “Your Google Apps account is enabled. You’re all set!”\n\nSet up forwarding from Outlook\n\nGo to https://outlook.office.com. Then, sign in with your university email.\nOnce at your inbox, click the gear icon in the top righthand corner of the page, which should bring up “Settings”. In the searchbar, search for “Forwarding”, then click on “Forwarding”.\nSelect “Enable forwarding”, and in the box under “Forward my email to”, put in your NetID, and then “@uits.arizona.edu”.\nMake sure to check the box next to “Keep a copy of forwarded messages”, which will keep a copy of each message in your Outlook inbox, in case something goes wrong during forwarding.\nClick “Save”, and your forwarding will be set up!\nAll future emails will then be sent to your UA Gmail inbox.\nYou can then sign into your Gmail account at https://mail.google.com (Or https://catmail.arizona.edu - but this sometimes doesn’t work.)",

    "text": "December 11, 2023\n\n28.0.1 Overview\nThis document contains information on what is needed to connect to databases from various Spreadsheets, to read and write data, and lists any restrictions where they exist\nIn general, it’s much easier to get data put directly into a spreadsheet from a database than to update a database from a spreadsheet. In all cases, using CSV files for reading and/o writing is a valid option\nThe use of CSV files instead of directly reading/writing to the database is supported by all spreadsheets\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet\nReading DB\nWriting DB\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Sheets ✔\n✔✔✔\n✔✔\nWrite scripts to move data; programming skills help\n\n\nNumbers ✖\n➖\n➖\n\n\n\nExcel (Windows) ✔\n✔✔✔\n✔\nUpdate DB with CSV is easiest; need ODBC driver\n\n\nExcel (Mac) ✔\n✔\n✔\nSQLServer is supported; buy other ODBC drivers\n\n\nLibreOffice Calc ≈\n✔✔\n➖\n\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet Rating: ✖  Not supported ✔ Supported ≈ Mixed support\nReading/Writing Difficulty: ✔ Hard ✔✔ Medium ✔✔✔ Easy ➖ Not supported\n\n\n28.0.2 How Tested\nA sample MySQL database was started on the OpenStack instance at the University of Arizona, and made publicly accessible (password protected)\nLibreOffice Calc was tested on an Ubuntu 22.04 system\nDifferent database instances may have different requirements. For example, needing to be on a particular VPN, or using two-factor authentication\n\n\n28.0.3 Google Sheets\nScripts are written to read and write data from a database using Google provided connectors\nRestrictions\nPostgres and its derivatives (PostGIS, et. al.) are not supported\nReading\nA generic Google Apps Script can be used to pull data into a spreadsheet and examples are easy to find. For example, https://www.lido.app/tutorials/google-sheets-connect-to-database. Adjust the SQL statement to meet your needs and be sure to specify what the sheet name is in the script(s)\nWriting\nWriting to the database can be easy if all the data in a spreadsheet is to be sent to a table in the database. Google documentation provides a simple way of doing that: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/jdbc. If data filtering is needed, or if data is from multiple sheets, then it’s necessary to accumulate each row of data to insert into the database before writing it. This can become complicated, so it might be easier to have a special sheet with the data to push to the database and use a generic script (with necessary modifications, such as table and column names)\nConclusion\nMost flexible solution for directly reading and writing to a database. However, some programming skills come in handy, and having a script separate from the spreadsheet seems a little weird\n\n\n28.0.4 Numbers\nThis Apple spreadsheet application doesn’t connect to databases. Use other means to use CSV files for fetching data fo the spreadsheet and updating the database\nConclusion\nNo database connections supported\n\n\n28.0.5 Excel (Windows)\nSetting up database connectivity can be painful and complicated, and may require a system administrator.\nReading\nConnect to the database using the ODBC connector that matches the database you are pulling data from. You can select tables and columns, or write SQL commands to fetch the data into your spreadsheet. Microsoft has a web page containing instructions for multiple data sources; scroll down to see the different sources and their instructions.\nThe following download links may help:\n\nVisual Studio redistributables: https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads\nODBC drivers: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/\n\nWriting\nIt’s much easier to upload a CSV file into the database than to use other methods. Depending upon the database, a search online can provide you with the means for directly writing to the database (or as directly as possible)\nFor example, MySQL methods for writing to the database can be found at https://nanonets.com/blog/import-excel-into-mysql/\nConclusion\nWhile it can be a pain getting the needed software onto the system, you only need to do it once for each database type. Excel provides a direct read/write solution to databases\n\n\n28.0.6 Excel (Mac)\nRestrictions\nOnly SQLServer is supported “out of the box”. For other databases it’s necessary to pay for an ODBC driver to connect\nReading\nUse the SQLServer connectors to read from the database, if that’s an option. Otherwise, generate a CSV file with the data wanted and load that into the spreadsheet\nWriting\nUse the SQLServer connectors to write to the database, if that’s an option. Otherwise, generate a CSV file with the generated data and upload that into the database\nConclusion\nIf you aren’t connecting to SQLServer, you need to use CSV files\n\n\n28.0.7 Libre Office Calc\nInstall the libreoffice-base package to add the Database option to Calc; this may require an administrator to perform and a reboot after it’s installed. Install the appropriate JDBC driver somewhere accessible on the system (you will navigate to the driver when establishing a connection in the next step)\nThe following instructions are written for the MySQL database, but can be easily adjusted for other databases: https://techsparx.com/blog/2016/08/libreoffice-mysql.html\nReading\nPerform a SQL Query to import the data into a spreadsheet\nWriting\nUnable to find a documented way to put data back into a modern relational database. Generate a CSV file and update the database with that\nConclusion\nEasier to set up on Linux-based systems than Excel on Windows is (see above for Excel on Mac). Pulling data directly is on par with other spreadsheet applications, but direct writing appears to be missing.",
