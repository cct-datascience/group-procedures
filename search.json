This will also be used to budget for the time and costs of future projects.\nThe goal is not to account for 100% of each person’s time. The goal is to be able to confidently and correctly report that we have spent a particular number of days or fraction of time on a project. Retrospective tracking with a precision of ~ 1 hour or half days is typically sufficient.\nMost members use toggl.com to track time, with a separate project for each funded activity."
