A public facing version of what we do and how to work with us is available at our website.\nThe CCT Data Science Team is a research support unit that helps life sciences researchers learn and apply data science tools and skills to their scientific projects. We are a small group of data scientists and research software engineers that work with domain researchers in the ALVSCE division through a variety of programming. We host workshops to demonstrate use of modern computational tools, work on collaborative projects, and help researchers one-on-one. The team teaches and applies a broad array of topics from best practices in R to version control using git to open and reproducible research workflows."

The goal is to be fair to our collaborators and funders by quantifying our time spent and making sure that we are fairly allocating our efforts across projects. This will also be used to budget for the time and costs of future projects.\nThe goal is not to account for 100% of each person’s time. The goal is to be able to confidently and correctly report that we have spent a particular number of days or fraction of time on a project. Retrospective tracking with a precision of ~ 1 hour or half days is typically sufficient.\nMost members use toggl.com to track time, with a separate project for each funded activity."

For example, a better work-life balance, freedom to solve interesting problems and opportunities to work with scientists and engineers at the cutting edge without the constraint of quarterly sales objectives.\nThe University has a structured system called UCAP, defined below, for standardizing positions and aligning salaries across campus with current market rates.\n\n11.0.3.1 The University Career Architecture Project (UCAP)\nSalaries, raises, and promotion are governed by the University Career Architecture Project. As an overview, most full time developers in our group will fall in the PC1-PC3 category as defined by the UA Work Dimensions spreadsheet. They will be in either the Research and Data Analysis or Research Engineering Job functions within the Research Job families.\nWe strive to have transparency and equity within the group as well as among our peers. Like most public institutions, salaries at the University of Arizona are public (the library lists salary databases by year). Salaries follow the University of Arizona Pay Structure.\nSalaries in DIAG range from $30k for a recent graduate to $85k for developers with 10-15 years of experience in relevant technologies and the ability to take on substantial leadership and mentoring roles.\n\n\n\n11.0.4 Appendix: Skills Matrix\nNote: 6 and 7 are specific to a pipeline job; other positions may have additional required/desired skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory of interest\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n1.

This is an ongoing opportunity for researchers in ALVSCE to work with our team to understand and take advantage of research opportunities enabled by new and emerging data resources and computing methods. This opportunity is open to all researchers and staff in ALVSCE.\nOur team of domain data scientists and software engineers has expertise in state-of-the-art technologies and methods alongside domain expertise. These include statistics, data synthesis, data management, GIS, simulation modeling, analytics, cloud and cluster computing, software design and engineering, visualization, and more. The ALVSCE Data Science Incubator will provide up to ten full-time days of support for ALVSCE projects spread over three months to work on focused, intensive, collaborative projects.\nWe invite short project plans (1-2 pages) for a data-intensive research collaboration focusing on a research problem with clearly defined outcomes. This support is funded by USDA Hatch funds, and can be leveraged to develop funding for longer term collaborations. See our project plan guidelines and contact the group at cct-datascience@arizona.edu for more information."

I looked over the goals we set out to accomplish in the original project plan, and I think we’ve done a good job meeting them.\n\nStatic QA/QC routines that check data prior to going into the database ✅\nStatic checks for whether data for a station was retrieved in the previous hour: I don’t think we put this one into place yet, but this could be a pretty simple addition to the report that just checks for NAs. I opened an issue to remind me to look into this.\nA simple R package to wrap the API ✅\nA “dynamic” QA/QC procedure that compares recent data to historical ✅\nA Cooperative Extension bulletin describing the new AZMet QA/QC procedures: I’d be happy to help spread the word and provide edits to a draft bulletin. I also need to write a blog-post for our website and promote the azmet R package.\nAvailability of code on GitHub with a permissive open source license ✅\n\nAt our meeting on Monday, we’ll discuss any final steps to the incubator phase and next steps for continued collaboration (i.e. funding continued work on the QA/QC report). We’ll also have a conversation about the incubator process itself—what worked well, what didn’t work, and what could be improved.\nLooking forward to seeing you then!\n\n\n\n\n\n14.5.2 Wrap-up Meeting\nHave a final meeting. Here are some questions you can ask:\n\nDo you feel like you have the resources you need to take ownership (with our continued support)?\nDo you feel we met the objectives of the project plan?\nDid the project take longer, shorter, or about as long as you expected?\nFor each phase of the incubator (project plan writing, work, and wrap-up): What went well? What didn’t go well? What suggestions do you have for improvement?\nIs it ok to share the product on our blog, social media, in UA newsletters, etc. (as appropriate)?\nWhat/when is the next step for continued work or funding (as appropriate)?\n\nTake notes on the answers and share them with the team at the next incubator meeting.\n\n\n14.5.3 After the meeting\n\nWrite a blog post on finished product, including links to repository and any other outputs. This can rely heavily on the project plan, README contents, other content generated during the project.\nAdd the incubator to our website\nDone isn’t defined as the end of the collaboration. We can still provide ongoing support during the publication process and through office hours, help define follow on projects, allocate time paid by external funding, assist in project plan development."

    "text": "17.4 Software\nIf you need a software license, first see if there are discounts for open source or academic users, and then ask Kristina if you need a license. When in doubt, ask. As with computers, she wants you to have the resources you need to be productive.\n\n17.4.1 RStudio\nFor R users, RStudio makes the development process easier, and we can assume that collaborators will use RStudio unless they have a reason not to. Many other great IDEs exist, e.g. VSCode, but it is okay in teaching, documentation, and demos to assume that learners will have access to RStudio.\n\n\n17.4.2 PyCharm\nWe are eligible for free PyCharm Educator licenses\nI received the following instructions in an email from customer support:\nif you are using this license for academic research, you are eligible to apply for a free Educational license below:\nhttp://www.jetbrains.com/student\nIf your institution domain is not available in the application, please attach your student/faculty ID and/or report card to the “OFFICIAL DOCUMENT” tab.\nTo Renew each year: (From their FAQ), “use the dedicated link in your JetBrains Account, or use a link from the automatic email reminder we send out one week before your subscription expires”\n\n\n17.4.3 Navicat\nWhen using databases, we can get licenses for open source projects as long as we put the Navicat logo on our website (as is done for TERRA REF).\n\n\n17.4.4 Postman\nA free program that is useful for investigating and creating API endpoints.\n\n\n17.4.5 Adobe tools:\nUA has a site license for these powerful tools. For example, Acrobat Pro for PDF annotation and signing; Adobe Xd for UI mockups. See https://adobe.arizona.edu/ for more information. Those whose primary appointment is in CCT will need to request a License from Ryan Creswan: cresawn@arizona.edu. Otherwse, there is a link to a spreadsheet with all of the Adobe campus reps on this page.\n\n\n17.4.6 Training Videos\nRecording Zoom sessions is a great place to start. But often it is useful to edit these videos.\n\nOBS Studio is an open source software for video recording, editing, and live streaming welcome.\nCamtasia is a commercial video editing software; contact Kristina if you would like a license.\nYou can also edit videos directly in YouTube with YouTube Studio\n\n\n\n17.4.7 GIS\n\nQGIS is a widely used and fully featured open source GIS IDE. We should use this for teaching and documentation (unless python or R will work and the workflow can be scripted).\nArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro run on Windows. UA has a campus license to these and other ESRI services. And for Windows users there is an Excel plugin for simple maps. UA GIS also provides https://uagis.maps.arcgis.com/ for sharing map data.\nTyson Swetnam has his Cloud based Ubuntu desktop enabled for GIS."

Then, go to catmail.arizona.edu and sign in. University emails sent to netID@arizona.edu (outlook) should now be forwarded to netID@email.arizona.edu (gmail).\n\nEnable Google Services\n\nIn order to enable Google services on your account, we will need to enable G-Suite on your account.\nTo enable G-Suite, you will need to sign in at https://account.arizona.edu with your NetID and password.\nThen, click on “Manage your Accounts” on the left-hand side of the page. You should now be on a page with “Existing Accounts” and “Available Accounts”.\nUnder “Available Accounts” should be “UA Google Apps for Education”. You will need to click that tile to enable G-Suite.\nAfter that, Google services should be available for you and we can set up forwarding.\nYou may already have Google Services enabled. If so you should see a large green banner that says: “Your Google Apps account is enabled. You’re all set!”\n\nSet up forwarding from Outlook\n\nGo to https://outlook.office.com. Then, sign in with your university email.\nOnce at your inbox, click the gear icon in the top righthand corner of the page, which should bring up “Settings”. In the searchbar, search for “Forwarding”, then click on “Forwarding”.\nSelect “Enable forwarding”, and in the box under “Forward my email to”, put in your NetID, and then “@uits.arizona.edu”.\nMake sure to check the box next to “Keep a copy of forwarded messages”, which will keep a copy of each message in your Outlook inbox, in case something goes wrong during forwarding.\nClick “Save”, and your forwarding will be set up!\nAll future emails will then be sent to your UA Gmail inbox.\nYou can then sign into your Gmail account at https://mail.google.com (Or https://catmail.arizona.edu - but this sometimes doesn’t work.)"
