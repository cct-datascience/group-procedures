## Task list

To get started creating a workshop, create a new issue on GitHub in the cct-datascience/organization repo using the Workshop Tasks issue template.
<!--# Shoul this instead by in the CALS-workshops repo? -->This will give you specific tasks to complete.
Refer to this document for more detailed instructions on specific tasks.

## Before the Workshop

### Creating a template for workshop Zoom meetings

The instructor running the workshop should set this up, as "Alternate Hosts" don't have any control over registrants.
Follow these instructions to create a template you can use for all future workshops.

1.  Log into Zoom in the browser [here](https://arizona.zoom.us/signin)
2.  Click "Schedule a Meeting" button
3.  Fill in "Topic" with "Workshop Wednesdays - \[topic\]"
4.  Select registration required
5.  Under Security section, select "Waiting Room" and (optional) "Passcode"
6.  Under Meeting Options section, select "Allow participants to join anytime", "Mute participants upon entry", and "Automatically record meeting"
7.  Click "Save" button
8.  Once created, go to the new meeting
9.  Scroll to bottom to Registration tab and hit edit on right hand side. Make changes as below: ![](https://i.imgur.com/laxI3Wz.png)
10. Go to 'Custom Questions' and add the following:
    -   What College at U of A do you belong to?
    -   What department(s) are you affiliated with?
    -   What is your career stage? (undergraduate, graduate, post doc, researcher/staff, faculty)
    -   How did you hear about this workshop?
    -   Can we add you to the CCT Data Science mailing list (no more than monthly announcements)?
11. Save and back at the meeting page click the "Save as Template" button to create a template for workshops.\
    This will save the meeting options and questions.

### Recording Settings

Change your settings so the active speaker and participants are recorded separately.

1.  Navigate to <https://arizona.zoom.us/profile/setting>
2.  In the "Recording" tab, make sure "Record active speaker with shared screen" is checked and "Record gallery view with shared screen" is not checked
3.  Set to record in the cloud rather than locally---if you record locally, then the particpant videos will block the corner of the view.

### Creating a Zoom event for a workshop

To create a Zoom registration for a specific workshop

1.  Log into <https://arizona.zoom.us/signin>
2.  Click "Schedule a Meeting" and in the "Template" field choose your template
3.  Edit the title, description, time, and alternate hosts fields, then click save
4.  On the meeting page, scroll to bottom to the Registration tab and click "edit" to the right of Registration Options
5.  Go to 'Custom Questions' and add any workshop-specific questions in the "Custom Questions" section

To view registration information, go to 'Analytics & Reports', 'Usage Reports', 'Meeting' and click 'Generate' to download a spreadsheet

From the meeting page, copy the registration link to be included in your workshop announcements

### Advertise

-   Add the workshop to our website at https://datascience.cals.arizona.edu/services-overview/workshops
-   Add the workshop to the Data Science Institute [events page](https://datascience.arizona.edu/get-involved)
-   Advertise to other groups and email listservs listed [here](https://osf.io/tzmhp/wiki/Public%20Communications/)

### Workshop reminder email (optional)

Zoom does not have a way to email all participants directly with a custom message, so you will need to download the registrants list to get all emails easily.

1.  Log into Zoom in the browser as per above
2.  Go to "Analytics & Reports" in the left hand size table of contents
3.  Select "Usage Reports" tab and "Meeting" option
4.  Enter time range including workshop date and hit "Search" button
5.  For workshop, click "Generate" link
6.  Open downloaded csv in order to copy all registrant emails

### Pre-workshop survey

Still a work-in-progress, but should ask questions about:

-   Skill level with tool(s)

-   Skill level with content

## During the workshop

-   Turn on automatic live transcript on Zoom
-   Start recording

### Beginning of workshop comments

-   Remind participants that it will be recorded

-   Record entire workshop session
-   After Zoom meeting is ended, a window will pop up with "Converting meeting recording". This will slow down your computer, but let it finish
-   The recording will be saved somewhere on your computer (it's "zoom_videos" for me)
-   Edit video locally if necessary
-   Ask Chris to give you admin permissions to the [CCT Data Science YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiBfho07gp4LMbWY3_EG8Iw)

-   If the video is unedited from the Zoom recording, you can upload the exported .vtt file for closed captions with timings
-   If possible, include thumbnail photo from a relevant slide
-   Add to the 'Workshops' playlist
-   Once it's uploaded (may take a while), including the HD version, check that the video is clear enough to see text on screen
-   Advertise video upload via Twitter!
