We have many options for publishing html documents, html-based slides, websites, shiny apps, APIs, etc. to the web.

-   **Posit Connect (previously 'RStudio Connect')**: UA has access to a Posit Connect server at viz.datascience.arizona.edu. This is an appropriate venue for publishing Shiny apps, Quarto or RMarkdown documents, datasets using the `pins` package, and `plumber` APIs [**for research purposes**](https://datascience.arizona.edu/analytics-powerhouse/posit-connect). Shiny for Python or Flask APIs can also be published to Posit Connect.
-   **Quarto Pub**: Our group has a Quarto Pub account that allows publishing of Quarto documents to [cct-datascience.quarto.pub](https://cct-datascience.quarto.pub/). This is appropriate for slides and notes used for teaching workshops. Course websites can be published here also, but because of size and traffic limitations, GitHub pages might be a better choice.
-   **GitHub pages**: We also have the ability to use GitHub pages for publishing content to the web. This is an appropriate venue for package documentation (e.g. `pkgdown` sites), project websites, and websites for short courses. This venue is also not limited to websites created via Quarto, RMarkdown, etc. so it is possibly an appropriate venue if there is a need for more flexible deployment.

## Quarto Pub

[quartopub.com](https://quartopub.com/) is probably the easiest way to share Quarto documents.
This is only for Quarto documents, and there is no option to make what you share private in any way.
Because Posit Connect is *technically* for research only, this is an appropriate venue for slides or other teaching related documents made with Quarto

### Getting Set Up:

We have an account with the username cct-datascience\@arizona.edu.
The password is stored in [Stache](https://stache.arizona.edu/) (you may need to ask for it to be shared with you).
Published documents appear at <https://cct-datascience.quarto.pub/>.

Publish here with `quarto publish quarto-pub` and the first time you'll be prompted to authenticate.
