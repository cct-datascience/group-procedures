Arizona Board of Regents requires at least one formal performance appraisal per year per employee.

The University of Arizona provides a standardized process called "Career Conversations" that is described in more detail in the links below.
We will have Annual Reviews in early January each year, prior to the first Quarterly Review.

Steps:

1.  Define your personal goals for the year; SMART goals provide a helpful framework

2.  [Review what SMART Goals are](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/setting-team-and-employee-goals-using-smart-methodology/how-to-use-smart-goals-2)
