# Regular Meetings

## Daily Standups {#standups}

We meet daily at 9:50 AM (unless we have a sprint planning or retrospective meeting that day) for approximately ten minutes.
The team member who leads the meeting is a rotating role that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4B59FdpGxAd2sNrgbXRLrYIVgcxjvnYF5yJoaIcOAA/edit?usp=sharing).
The leader is responsible for keeping the Standup on track and on time.
Everyone answers the following questions:

-   What did you do yesterday?

-   What are you planning to do today?

-   **Is anything blocking your work?**

This often leads to more in depth discussions which should be identified as tangential.
The leader or any other team member should suggest that the participants continue their discussion after the meeting or at a different time.
