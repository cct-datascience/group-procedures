## Documents and Websites to Update regularly

-   [CCT Data Science website](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/)
-   [CCT Service Catalog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LIxkktiP219_Xd24vXpgA1Qz7j7WcuRORtN26p2Qujw/edit)

## Where to announce events:

Besides our email listserv, we have a [spreadsheet of places to announce events](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/155tcna1dMWwsZymdKFZPCrnZf3xocw4hPv1JKwOu9MQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0) Feel free to add to or update it.

## Group Email Listserv {#listserv}

We currently maintain our email list on the Emma platform.
We send out \~quarterly emails, and people can sign up for our listserv using the link on our [contact page](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/contact).

We also add people manually to this mailing list, for example, after registering for a workshop and opting in to the mailing list as one of the registration questions.
<!--# unclear if this is technically possible with Trellis lol -->

How to send out emails:

-   Ask Matt Rahr to enable your account on Emma
-   Sign in using your UA email address
-   Select "Campaigns" tab and click "Create New Campaign" button
-   Add relevant campaign name, including year and quarter, and keep default "Regular email" option
-   Select most recent template
-   Update email text
-   Click "Preview" button to see what it will look like to recipients
-   Click "Review & send" button to finalize
-   Under "Choose recipients", add group called "Group announcements: workshop & other"
-   Add subject line and (optional) preheader text
-   Leave Sender name and Sender email as is
-   Hit "Send now" button to send email

## Group Emails

We have two shared emails, `cct-datascience@arizona.edu` and `cct-datascience-admins@arizona.edu`.
These should go to all people in the group.
When you respond, it will be from your address but please keep the original group email address in cc as long as is useful.

-   `cct-datascience@arizona.edu` is the general 'how to contact us', for use in websites, business cards, posters, etc, in many cases alongside a personal email address.

-   `cct-datascience-admins@arizona.edu` is for shared accounts, licenses, billing etc.
    Remember to add passwords to [Stache](https://stache.arizona.edu/) and share with group members when creating new accounts.

## Social Media

### Twitter

We no longer post to our Twitter/X account [\@cct_datascience](https://twitter.com/cct_datascience)

### Mastodon / fediverse

We have a mastodon account [\@cct_datascience\@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@cct_datascience).
To log in, you'll find the password on [stache](https://stache.arizona.edu/) (you may need to ask for it to be shared with you if you don't see it)

#### Guidelines

-   Please review the group [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.qmd) before posting to ensure you adhere to these guidelines
-   Including relevant pictures in posts are encouraged. **Please get explicit verbal/written consent from everyone in the picture before posting.** Tag people in the pictures who are on Mastodon **with their permission**
-   Cite sources and mention users (\@journal or \@author) in posts when applicable
-   If anyone comments on a post, make sure to respond to them, especially if it's a question.
-   All posts and replies should include at least one mention of a user or organization, or a relevant hashtag. These elements can bring others into a conversation, make our content more visible to a wider audience, and generate more engagement and followers.
-   Example hashtags: #UArizona, #UniversityOfArizona, #Rstats, #DataScience, #DigitalAg, #DataViz, #AcademicChatter, #RSEng

#### Ideas for posts

-   Feel free to get creative! This is just a limited list of possible selections.
-   Content should be directly in line with our [mission statement](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/about)
-   Announcements of recent group activities, e.g., quarterly review meeting
-   Short summary & link to a recent publication from the group or collaborators
-   Notification of recent release of group's software or documentation
-   Relevant upcoming events, e.g., conferences or hackathons that group members are attending
-   Link to recently posted news article on [group website](https://datascience.cct.arizona.edu/news) (new and improved website coming soon!)
-   Link to good resources for the type of work we do, e.g., blog post for how to use an R package
-   Live coverage of an event like a conference talkâ€”this can be a difficult thing to do

#### Boosts/Favorites

-   Content related to UA data science and/or ALVSCE related

#### Following

-   University of Arizona, agriculture, ecology, open science, computational, scientific software, data science

#### Follow Backs

-   When a new user or group follows us, we should follow back if they're a collaborator, well-known organization, associated with the University, or meet the guidelines above for Following in general. When in doubt, check with another team member.

#### Comments on other posts

-   Follow guidelines for other types of posts, including seeking approval before posting.

#### Link Roundups

-   TBD

## Group Blog

### Suggestions

-   Feel free to collaborate with others inside or outside of the team for relevant blog posts
-   Write your name next to an idea if you'd like to claim it

### Ideas

-   Real-world examples of how open data / open science / cross-disciplinary collaboration has advanced data-driven discovery
-   Tools to enable researchers to provision their own computing infrastructure
-   Culture of collaboration and user-focused development for scientific / research software - Agile / Lean / Pair Programming / Mob Programming
-   Power of DAG (directed acyclic graphs) workflows with applications for large-scale agricultural data pipelines
-   Mini hackathons for collaborative idea generation and team-building
-   Using modern IDE's like PyCharm effectively for scientific software development (NumPy, Jupyter, Docker, profiling, debugging, and automatic style / code smell detection)
-   Github for project management
-   Personal experiences of how ResBaz, R-Ladies, Python / GIS / UAV MeetUps, etc. have advanced your own professional development through knowledge-sharing, networking, and cross-disciplinary collaboration
-   Going beyond the metadata buzzword with explanations using agricultural data science / data pipeline examples

## Group Branding {#branding}

Projects that we work on such as websites/web apps, or presentations given by us or our collaborators should include some recognition of our group's contribution.
For guidelines on receiving recognition for our work on publications, software, and datasets see [authorship and licensing guidelines](getting-credit.qmd).

### Guidelines

-   Include "The University of Arizona" as part of our group name, especially if project is externally facing
-   Always use official group logo (TBD)
-   Always include a link, QR code, or tinyurl that leads to our group website
-   Abbreviating CCT is fine for most cases

### Where to include

-   Footer of GitHub README.md for all projects
-   Web apps (e.g. Shiny apps) built for incubators (on landing page or footer)
-   Contributors or acknowledgement page if a project has one
-   `pkgdown` websites for R packages (can put in "getting started" vignette to be on home page)
-   Project websites
-   Posters and slides presented by collaborators at conferences
-   Other printed materials presented by collaborators (banners, handouts, signs, etc.) when appropriate
