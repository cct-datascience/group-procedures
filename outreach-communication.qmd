## Group Emails

We have two shared emails, `cct-datascience@arizona.edu` and `cct-datascience-admins@arizona.edu`.
These should go to all people in the group.
When you respond, it will be from your address but please keep the original group email address in cc as long as is useful.

-   `cct-datascience@arizona.edu` is the general 'how to contact us', for use in websites, business cards, posters, etc, in many cases alongside a personal email address.

### Suggestions

-   Feel free to collaborate with others inside or outside of the team for relevant blog posts
-   Write your name next to an idea if you'd like to claim it

### Ideas

-   Real-world examples of how open data / open science / cross-disciplinary collaboration has advanced data-driven discovery
-   Tools to enable researchers to provision their own computing infrastructure
-   Culture of collaboration and user-focused development for scientific / research software - Agile / Lean / Pair Programming / Mob Programming
-   Power of DAG (directed acyclic graphs) workflows with applications for large-scale agricultural data pipelines
-   Mini hackathons for collaborative idea generation and team-building
-   Using modern IDE's like PyCharm effectively for scientific software development (NumPy, Jupyter, Docker, profiling, debugging, and automatic style / code smell detection)
-   Github for project management
-   Personal experiences of how ResBaz, R-Ladies, Python / GIS / UAV MeetUps, etc. have advanced your own professional development through knowledge-sharing, networking, and cross-disciplinary collaboration
-   Going beyond the metadata buzzword with explanations using agricultural data science / data pipeline examples

## Group Branding {#branding}

Projects that we work on such as websites/web apps, or presentations given by us or our collaborators should include some recognition of our group's contribution.
For guidelines on receiving recognition for our work on publications, software, and datasets see [authorship and licensing guidelines](getting-credit.qmd).

### Guidelines

-   Include "The University of Arizona" as part of our group name, especially if project is externally facing
-   Always use official group logo (TBD)
-   Always include a link, QR code, or tinyurl that leads to our group website
-   Abbreviating CCT is fine for most cases

### Where to include

-   Footer of GitHub README.md for all projects
-   Web apps (e.g. Shiny apps) built for incubators (on landing page or footer)
-   Contributors or acknowledgement page if a project has one
-   `pkgdown` websites for R packages (can put in "getting started" vignette to be on home page)
-   Project websites
-   Posters and slides presented by collaborators at conferences
-   Other printed materials presented by collaborators (banners, handouts, signs, etc.) when appropriate
