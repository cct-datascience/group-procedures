We send out \~quarterly emails to a mailing list that people can sign up for using this link: <https://app.e2ma.net/app2/audience/signup/1965047/1923145/>\
\
We also add people manually to this mailing list, for example, after registering for a workshop and opting in to the mailing list as one of the registration questions.

## Managing Emma

To log into <https://home.e2ma.net/>, you will first need to be added as an administrator by Matt Rahr.

To add people to the mailing list, go to the "Audience" tab and click the "Add contact" button.
When adding contacts, include at least name, email, and UA College, if applicable.
If they are in CALES, you may also select a department from the UA Department drop-down menu.
