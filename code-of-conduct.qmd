title: Code of Conduct

## Overview

Our group's mission is to enable scientists. This means treating people with respect and responding in a polite and helpful way.

Our group is committed to ensuring a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by members, collaborators, and contributors include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

## University of Arizona Policies 

The University of Arizona has specific policies related to conduct. See the [UA Nondiscrimination and anti-harrassment policy][2]. 

All employees students, and designated campus colleagues are required to take the [Preventing Harassment and Discrimination training][3] and follow review, understand, and follow:
* The University of Arizona ethics and conduct guidelines: policy.arizona.edu/ethics-and-conduct
* The University of Arizona Nondiscrimination and anti-harassment policy: titleix.arizona.edu/nondiscrimination_and_anti-harassment_policy

## Inclusivity

Our group is a Safe & Inclusive Space. You should feel welcome, we should make sure everyone feels welcome and respected. In our work to enable science we will work with each other as well as diverse stakeholders from within and outside the University of Arizona. We are committed to creating an environment that supports inclusivity and respect of all people regardless of race, color, culture, religion, spiritual practice, sex, age, socioeconomic status, perceived or actual sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression, relationship status or configuration, national origin or physical and mental abilities.
