    -   Lomax can connect you to the color copier downstairs; create a ticket to request his help: <https://keating.bio5.org/ticket_support/tickets.php>
-   Mail: there is a group mailbox in the mailroom on the N(orth) side of the building.
-   Packages: if you receive a package you will be notified by email.

### Commuting

-   Bike Commuting (Kudos if you commute by bike!):
    -   There are lockers and showers in the basement that you can use. Find a locker and ask Robert if you can use it.
    -   There is a bike storage area on the loading dock; ask Robert for the code.
    -   [TUGO](https://tugobikeshare.com/) is great for getting around campus
