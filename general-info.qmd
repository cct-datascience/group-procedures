## On Campus Work

### Offices

We have dedicated office space in the [Bioscience Research Laboratory](https://bsrl.arizona.edu/) (BSRL), and can also use the CCT offices/conference room in Forbes if coordinated in advance.

    -   Submit a ticket for either IT support or miscellaneous building-related issues: <https://keating.bio5.org/ticket_support/>
-   Copy machine and fax use
    -   Create a ticket if you need help connecting to the color copier downstairs: <https://keating.bio5.org/ticket_support/>
-   Mail: there is a group mailbox in the mailroom on the N(orth) side of the building.
-   Packages: if you receive a package you will be notified by email.

### Commuting

-   Bike Commuting (Kudos if you commute by bike!):
    -   There are lockers and showers in the basement that you can use. Find a locker and ask Robert if you can use it.
    -   There is a bike storage area on the loading dock; ask Robert for the code.
    -   [TUGO](https://tugobikeshare.com/) is great for getting around campus
-   Parking: Easiest parking is the garage two blocks east of BSRL: \$2 hourly or \$8 daily.
-   Public Transportation: The [Sunlink Streetcar](https://www.suntran.com/routes-services/sunlink/) stops very close to BSRL on Helen and is currently free. All Sun Tran rides are also free.
