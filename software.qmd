## Overview of IT services

### [UA Information Technology](https://it.arizona.edu/)

For information on available services and procedures, see the [UITS getting started page](https://it.arizona.edu/getting-started).

Excellent [24-7 support](https://it.arizona.edu/service/247-it-support): (520) 626-TECH (8324)

### [UA Research Computing](https://it.arizona.edu/research)

The "[University of Arizona Cyberinfrastructure and Research Support](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/download/attachments/86409304/University_Arizona_Cyberinfrastructure_Report%281%29.docx?version=1&modificationDate=1602083298000&api=v2)" Report provides a comprehensive inventory of UA computing resources.

### Bio5 IT group <!--# do we need this section? -->

-   To request IT support, you can submit a ticket at <https://keating.bio5.org/ticket_support/>.
-   You can also contact the IT group lead Lomax Boyd ([lomax\@bio5.org](mailto:lomax@bio5.org)) for any other questions or concerns.

## Cloud & High Performance Computing

### Campus Cluster

Every group gets a generous monthly allocation by default, plus infinite lower priority time as available.

To request access to the computer using our group allocations, please:

1.  Go to <https://account.arizona.edu/account/index> to create a HPC account
2.  Open <https://portal.hpc.arizona.edu/portal/sendlink.php> and enter 'kristinariemer\@arizona.edu' in the sponsors email field.
3.  If needed, refer to [documentation for details](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Account+Creation)

Overview of Campus HPC Resources: <https://docs.hpc.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/HPC+Documentation>

Puma has lots of GPUs:

-   [Puma Quick Start](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Puma+Quick+Start)

### OpenStack

OpenStack is a cloud computing platform similar to AWS and other commercial clouds (except that it is open!) and we have allocations on CyVerse's OpenStack environments.

### [Exosphere](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere)

An experimental open stack interface being developed by Julian.
He would appreciate feedback and feature requests.
See project [README](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/blob/master/README.md?ref_type=heads) for install instructions.

## Development / Collaboration Tools:

General philosophy is that each person should use what works; for collaborative work it helps to use the same tools!
Feel free to suggest alternatives... tools like GitHub and Slack are chosen because they are the widely adopted and feature-rich.

-   When specifying a new task/app/tool identify why it's needed; what's to be gained

### Slack

-   Instant Messaging, quickly sharing documents and code snippets, etc
-   Video Conferencing

### Zoom

-   Documentation: <https://it.arizona.edu/service/zoom>
-   Video conferencing (more robust and feature rich than Slack)
-   Unless otherwise specified, if you are joining a meeting remotely we will meet in the group room (link pinned to our Slack channel)

### Other Document Sharing Services

These aren't our primary way of sharing documents, but it will be prudent to set up account because they are sometimes useful.

-   Box
    -   Documentation <https://it.arizona.edu/service/boxua>
    -   Access <https://arizona.account.box.com/login>
-   Office 365
    -   Documentation <https://it.arizona.edu/service/microsoft-office-365>

## Software

If you need a software license, first see if there are discounts for open source or academic users, and then ask Kristina if you need a license.
When in doubt, ask.
As with computers, she wants you to have the resources you need to be productive.

### RStudio

For R users, RStudio makes the development process easier, and we can assume that collaborators will use RStudio unless they have a reason not to.
Many other great IDEs exist, e.g.
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but it is okay in teaching, documentation, and demos to assume that learners will have access to RStudio.

### PyCharm

We are eligible for free PyCharm Educator licenses

I received the following instructions in an email from customer support:

*if you are using this license for academic research, you are eligible to apply for a free Educational license below:*

*http://www.jetbrains.com/student*

*If your institution domain is not available in the application, please attach your student/faculty ID and/or report card to the "OFFICIAL DOCUMENT" tab.*

**To Renew each year:** (From their [FAQ](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)), *"use the dedicated link in your JetBrains Account, or use a link from the automatic email reminder we send out one week before your subscription expires"*

### Navicat

When using databases, we can get licenses for open source projects as long as we put the Navicat logo on our website (as is done for TERRA REF).

### Postman

A free program that is useful for investigating and creating API endpoints.

### Adobe tools:

UA has a site license for these powerful tools.
For example, Acrobat Pro for PDF annotation and signing; Adobe Xd for UI mockups.
See <https://adobe.arizona.edu/> for more information.
Those whose primary appointment is in CCT will need to request a License from Ryan Creswan: cresawn\@arizona.edu.
Otherwse, there is a link to a spreadsheet with all of the Adobe campus reps [on this page](https://softwarelicense.arizona.edu/adobe-shared-device-licensing).

### Training Videos

Recording Zoom sessions is a great place to start.
But often it is useful to edit these videos.

-   [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) is an open source software for video recording, editing, and live streaming welcome.
-   [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a commercial video editing software; contact Kristina if you would like a license.
-   You can also edit videos directly in YouTube with YouTube Studio

### GIS

-   [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is a widely used and fully featured open source GIS IDE. We should use this for teaching and documentation (unless python or R will work and the workflow can be scripted).
-   ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro run on Windows. [UA has a campus license](https://softwarelicense.arizona.edu/esri) to these and other ESRI services. And for Windows users there is an Excel plugin for simple maps. UA GIS also provides <https://uagis.maps.arcgis.com/> for sharing map data.
-   Tyson Swetnam has his Cloud based Ubuntu desktop enabled for GIS.
