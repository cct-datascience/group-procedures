## Overview of IT services

### [UA Information Technology](https://it.arizona.edu/)

For information on available services and procedures, see the [UITS getting started page](https://it.arizona.edu/getting-started).

Excellent [24-7 support](https://it.arizona.edu/service/247-it-support): (520) 626-TECH (8324)

### [UA Research Computing](https://it.arizona.edu/research)

The "[University of Arizona Cyberinfrastructure and Research Support](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/download/attachments/86409304/University_Arizona_Cyberinfrastructure_Report%281%29.docx?version=1&modificationDate=1602083298000&api=v2)" Report provides a comprehensive inventory of UA computing resources.

### Bio5 IT group <!--# do we need this section? -->

-   To request IT support, you can submit a ticket at <https://keating.bio5.org/ticket_support/>.
-   You can also contact the IT group lead Lomax Boyd ([lomax\@bio5.org](mailto:lomax@bio5.org)) for any other questions or concerns.

## Computing <!--# this is hardware, not software. Does this belong here? -->

### Computers

You should have the resources you need to be productive.
If your hardware is slowing you down, ask Kristina.
But if you already have 16 GB RAM and a modern computer, it may be time to investigate using cloud resources (see HPC and OpenStack, below).

### Backup

If you loose your computer or it breaks, it should take \< Â½ day to get it back up and running.
There is no excuse for failing to backup your work.

-   All work should be pushed to GitHub daily.
-   UA provides access to Google Drive, Box, and Microsoft OneDrive. These are useful for backups.
-   You can also ask Kristina to purchase an external hard drive for you

If this is not sufficient, we can set up a service at <https://it.arizona.edu/documentation/data-backup-service-tiers>.

### Campus Cluster

Every group gets a generous monthly allocation by default, plus infinite lower priority time as available.

To request access to the computer using our group allocations, please:

1.  Go to <https://account.arizona.edu/account/index> to create a HPC account
2.  Open <https://portal.hpc.arizona.edu/portal/sendlink.php> and enter 'kristinariemer\@arizona.edu' in the sponsors email field.
3.  If needed, refer to [documentation for details](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Account+Creation)

Overview of Campus HPC Resources: <https://docs.hpc.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/HPC+Documentation>

Puma has lots of GPUs: \* [Puma Quick Start](https://public.confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Puma+Quick+Start)

-   Point of contact is Blake Joyce; he can be contacted on the CyVerse Slack or bjoyce3\@arizona.edu

### [CyVerse](https://www.cyverse.org/)

This group is our neighbor.
We should leverage their expertise and make use of their services wherever possible!
<!--# Is this still true? -->

-   Our servers and pipelines are hosted on the CyVerse openstack

-   VICE (<https://www.cyverse.org/webinar-visual-and-interactive-comp>) provides cloud computing environments including Rstudio and Jupyter

-   <!--# Is this still relevant? -->

    Discovery Environment

    -   <!--# link was broken becasue folder was deleted -->

        A "quick start" guide to making a DE app may be found [here](https://github.com/cct-datascience/organization/blob/c39713cd3319e8a07aaebda9a4be917874a58136/meeting-notes/2020-01-15_deploying-vice-apps.md)

-   Data Store: CyVerse's data storage and transfer protocol is built on iRods.

### OpenStack

OpenStack is a cloud computing platform similar to AWS and other commercial clouds (except that it is open! and we have allocations on CyVerse's OpenStack environments. The TERRA REF project also makes use of OpenStack at NCSA.

#### OpenStack Interface for Tombstone <!--# what is tombstone? -->

-   url: <https://tombstone-cloud.cyverse.org/>
-   domain: cso
-   Password: find your secrets at <https://stache.arizona.edu>

#### [Exosphere](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere)

-   An experimental open stack interface being developed by Julian.
    He would appreciate feedback and feature requests.
    See project [README](https://gitlab.com/exosphere/exosphere/-/blob/master/README.md?ref_type=heads) for install instructions.

-   By default it logs you into a demo account, but you can click on the 'Add Provider' and enter your own Tombstone Cloud credentials <!--# is this still relevant? -->:

    -   Auth URL: https://tombstone-cloud.cyverse.org:5000/v3
    -   Project Domain: 4fdb4218c06542498c42e767eaa5afb0
    -   Project Name: cals
    -   User Domain: 4fdb4218c06542498c42e767eaa5afb0
    -   User name: <your UA NetID>
    -   Password: <In Stache>

(If nothing seems to happen after submitting the credentials form, it probably worked. Just click on the Tombstone provider on the left.)

### Globus <!--# Is this still relevant? -->

If you want to download lots of data for the terraref project, register for an account on globus.org.
You will need to download and install Globus Connect Personal and ask Kristina to grant you access to the Terraref endpoint.

# Development / Collaboration Tools:

General philosophy is that each person should use what works; for collaborative work it helps to use the same tools!
Feel free to suggest alternatives... tools like GitHub and Slack are chosen because they are the widely adopted and feature-rich.

-   When specifying a new task/app/tool identify why it's needed; what's to be gained

## Slack

-   Instant Messaging, quickly sharing documents and code snippets, etc
-   Video Conferencing

## Zoom

-   Documentation: <https://it.arizona.edu/service/zoom>
-   Video conferencing (more robust and feature rich than Slack)
-   Unless otherwise specified, if you are joining a meeting remotely we will meet at arizona.zoom.us/my/dlebauer

## UA OSF

-   One motivation for using OSF vs. alternatives is to use and support software from groups with aligned missions: in this case both OSF and the UA library
-   Provides wiki
-   Can archive and mint doi's
-   Single Interface to github, google docs, Box, and more

## Other Document Sharing Services

These aren't our primary way of sharing documents, but it will be prudent to set up account because they are sometimes useful.

-   Globus (mostly for accessing data from TERRA REF) https://www.globus.org/
-   Box
    -   Documentation <https://it.arizona.edu/service/boxua>
    -   Access <https://arizona.account.box.com/login>
-   Office 365
    -   Documentation <https://it.arizona.edu/service/microsoft-office-365>

# Software

If you need a software license, first see if there are discounts for open source or academic users, and then ask Kristina if you need a license.
When in doubt, ask.
As with computers, he wants you to have the resources you need to be productive.

## Rstudio

For R users, Rstudio makes the development process easier, and we can assume that collaborators will use Rstudio unless they have a reason not to.
Many other great IDEs exist - e.g.
Emacs has ESS mode that is fantastic - but it is okay in teaching, documentation, and demos to assume that learners will have access to Rstudio.

## PyCharm

We are eligible for free PyCharm Edicatopm licenses

I received the following instructions in an email from customer support:

*if you are using this license for academic research, you are eligible to apply for a free Educational license below:*

*http://www.jetbrains.com/student*

*If your institution domain is not available in the application, please attach your student/faculty ID and/or report card to the "OFFICIAL DOCUMENT" tab.*

**To Renew each year:** (From their [FAQ](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)), *"use the dedicated link in your JetBrains Account, or use a link from the automatic email reminder we send out one week before your subscription expires"*

## Navicat

When using Databases, we can get licenses for open source projects as long as we put the Navicat logo on our website (as is done for TERRA REF).

## Postman

A free program that is useful for investigating and creating API endpoints.

## Adobe tools:

UA has a site license for these powerful tools.
For example, Acrobat Pro for PDF annotation and signing; Adobe Xd for UI mockups.
See <http://odltools.arizona.edu/tools/adobe-creative-cloud> for more information.
Those whose primary appointment is in DIAG/CCT will need to request a License from Ryan Creswan: cresawn\@cals.arizona.edu.
Otherwse, there is a link to a spreadsheet with all of the Adobe campus reps [on this page](https://softwarelicense.arizona.edu/adobe-shared-device-licensing).

## Training Videos

Recording Zoom sessions is a great place to start.
But often it is useful to edit these videos.

-   [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) is an open source software for video recording, editing, and live streaming welcome.
-   [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) is a commercial video editing software; contact Kristina if you would like a license.

## GIS

-   [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) is a widely used and fully featured open source GIS IDE. We should use this for teaching and documentation (unless python or R will work and the workflow can be scripted).
-   ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro run on Windows. [UA has a campus license](https://softwarelicense.arizona.edu/esri) to these and other ESRI services. And for Windows users there is an Excel plugin for simple maps. UA GIS also provides https://uagis.maps.arcgis.com/ for sharing map data.
-   Tyson Swetnam has his Cloud based Ubuntu desktop enabled for GIS.
