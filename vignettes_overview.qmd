## Purpose

The vignettes are to document technical skills and approaches that our group members learn, that are not well-documented in other places, e.g., online tutorials, blog posts.
Creating these vignettes provide a way to share knowledge amongst and outside the group as we learn new things.

## Process

1.  Investigate the desired skill using existing documentation and by using the tool / approach
2.  Summarize findings in a Quarto document and add it to this section of the Group Procedures book
3.  Share, when appropriate:
    -   With the group as a demo during sprint planning
    -   With collaborators via email or meeting
    -   With the broader public via Mastodon or a blog post

## Possible vignette topics

-   Sending automated emails using University of Arizona's instance of Posit Connect
-   Using Jetstream 2 to set up virtual machines
-   Connecting spreadsheets with databases
